# Simple Platformer (Godot)

### `In development'

A simple 2D platformer made with Godot where the player â€” a ninja â€” navigates through platforms, attacks dummies, and reaches the goal.

## ðŸš€ Gameplay

- Use arrow keys to move.
- Press A to jump (with doublejump).
- Press X to attack with a sword.
- The player can deal damage, with a chance for critical hits.
- Dummies (enemies) can receive damage and die.
- Reaching the goal zone likely finishes the level.

## ðŸ§  Key Mechanics

### Player
- Controlled via `player.gd`
- Has an attack system using a sword hitbox (`sword_hitbox.gd`)
- Can deal damage and trigger critical hits

### Enemy (Dummy)
- Script: `dummy.gd`
- Receives damage and plays hit reactions

### UI Feedback
- `DamageLabel.tscn` and `CritLabel.tscn` show floating numbers for damage and critical hits

### Goal
- `GoalZone.gd` handles level completion logic

- `Player.tscn`: Contains player node and logic
- `Dummy.tscn`: Enemy scene
