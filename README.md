# Simple Platformer (Godot)

`In development`

A simple 2D platformer made with Godot where the player â€” a ninja â€” navigates through platforms, attacks enemies, and reaches the goal.

## ðŸš€ Gameplay

- Use arrow keys to move.
- Press A to jump (with doublejump).
- Press X to attack with a sword.
- The player can deal damage, with a chance for critical hits.
- Enemies can receive damage, show health bars, and die with knockback effects.
- Reaching the goal zone likely finishes the level.

## ðŸ§  Key Mechanics

### Player
- Controlled via `player.gd`
- Has an attack system using a sword hitbox (`sword_hitbox.gd`)
- Can deal damage and trigger critical hits

### Enemy System
- Base class: `enemy_class.gd`
  - Core health and damage systems
  - Knockback and stun mechanics
  - Health bar and damage feedback
  - Death animations and cleanup
- Specific enemies:
  - `turtle_enemy.gd`: Turtle enemy
  - `dummy_enemy.gd`: Basic enemy implementation

### UI Feedback
- `HealthBar.tscn`: Dynamic health bars for enemies
  - Color changes based on health percentage
  - Shake effect on damage
- `DamageLabel.tscn` and `CritLabel.tscn`: Show floating numbers for damage and critical hits

### Goal
- `GoalZone.gd` handles level completion logic
